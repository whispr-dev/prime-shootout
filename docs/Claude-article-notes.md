Key narrative beats I threaded through:



Claude = speed + correctness, zero errors

ChatGPT = elegance + near-perfect, beautiful code

Gemini/Grok = messy iterations, functional but graceless

Hardware techniques (SIMD/parallel) beat cleverness

2,300-year-old algorithm remains unbeaten

Humans can hold their own — AI accelerates, doesn't replace
